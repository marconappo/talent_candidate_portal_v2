        <answers>Wait for your manager for as long as it takes. When
they arrive pretend that everything is fine and do
your best to behave professionally.

MOST EFFECTIVE LEASTEFFECTIVE
Wait for your manager for as long as it takes, but
when they do come back explain that it has been a
long week, you're tired and that you feel they have
been unreasonable in asking you to wait for so
long

MOST EFFECTIVE LEASTEFFECTIVE
Try to call your manager on their mobile to see
where they are and whether they still want you to
wait. If you can't get hold of them leave them a
message then go home. You've done your best to
contact them and they can't reasonably expect you
to wait for them indefinitely

MOST EFFECTIVE LEASTEFFECTIVE
Decide to leave. Assume that they have probably
forgotten they asked you to wait for them, and even
if they haven't, accept that you have waited as long
as could be considered reasonable.

        <question>You’ve had a really long and tiring week and you’re looking forward to going home for the weekend. Ten minutes before you’re about to leave your manager asks if they can have a quick word and asks you to wait whilst they quickly catch a colleague in IT. An hour later they have not returned.

Please consider the situation and then select which statement you feel is the most effective and the least effective response or action from the four statements.</question>
